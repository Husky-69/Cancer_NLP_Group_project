# Cancer Information Retrieval NLP Model (for Bot Integration)

## Project Overview

The **Cancer Information Retrieval NLP Model** is a retrieval-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) system designed to provide accurate and immediate answers to user queries related to cancer. This project aims to enhance access to trustworthy medical information, alleviate the burden of routine inquiries on healthcare staff, and combat the spread of misinformation often found online, by providing a robust NLP backend ready for integration with various bot platforms.

The system comprises a core NLP model that retrieves answers from a trusted medical dataset (MedQuAD) and exposes its functionality via an API, allowing it to be consumed by an existing or new bot.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend (NLP Model & API):**

  * Python

  * `pandas` (for data handling)

  * `numpy` (for numerical operations)

  * `scikit-learn` (for text processing, e.g., TF-IDF)

  * `spaCy` / `NLTK` (for advanced NLP tasks like tokenization, stemming/lemmatization)

  * Sentence-BERT (or similar embedding models for semantic similarity)

  * Flask / FastAPI (for building the REST API)

## Business Understanding

Healthcare providers are under growing pressure to reduce costs, enhance patient engagement, and deliver accurate information without overburdening staff. As patients increasingly turn to the internet—often encountering unreliable content—automated Q&A systems built on trusted sources like MedQuAD offer a scalable, reliable alternative. This project aims to develop a retrieval-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that responds to cancer-related user queries by matching them to the most relevant questions in the dataset, improving access to trustworthy medical information while reducing manual support demands. This NLP model is designed to serve as a robust backend for integration into various bot platforms, optimizing information dissemination and combating misinformation.
