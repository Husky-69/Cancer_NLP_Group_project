    "A crucial step in data understanding is to examine the dataset's descriptive statistics and identify any inherent limitations. This helps in making informed decisions for subsequent data preparation and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of `question`, `answer`, and `source` columns. As these are primarily text-based features, traditional numerical descriptive statistics (like mean, std dev) are not directly applicable. Instead, we focus on properties relevant to text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset Size:** As observed during loading, the dataset contains 729 entries (Q&A pairs) and 3 columns.\n",
    "* **Unique Sources:** There are 116 distinct source files from which the Q&A pairs were extracted, indicating the breadth of the medical topics covered.\n",
    "* **Null Values:** We will explicitly check for any missing values in the `question` or `answer` columns, as these would directly impact the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Limitations:**\n",
    "While comprehensive, this dataset might have certain limitations that could impact the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Specificity of Questions:** The questions are related to \"cancer.\" The model's effectiveness will be limited to this domain; it cannot answer general medical queries.\n",
    "* **Vocabulary and Jargon:** Medical text often contains highly specialized vocabulary. While necessary for accuracy, this might require robust text preprocessing (e.g., handling acronyms, medical terms not in standard dictionaries) and potentially large vocabulary models.\n",
    "* **Ambiguity and Nuance:** Natural language, especially in a medical context, can be ambiguous or require nuanced understanding (e.g., distinguishing similar conditions). A retrieval-based model may struggle with highly nuanced or subjective queries.\n",
    "* **Static Dataset:** As a static dataset, it won't inherently update with new medical discoveries or evolving information. A production system would require mechanisms for periodic data refreshes.\n",
    "* **Bias in Source Data:** Although from reputable sources, any inherent biases or outdated information present in the original XML files will be reflected in the model's responses."

    "\n",
    "After initial cleaning, the textual content of the question and answer columns requires meticulous preprocessing to enhance consistency and relevance for NLP tasks. Medical text often presents unique challenges, such as specialized terminology, boilerplate phrases, and variations in formatting. The following steps standardize the text, making it more digestible for the retrieval model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining a Custom Text Cleaning Function (clean_text)\n",
    "To handle the specific characteristics of medical text, a custom function clean_text is implemented. This function performs a series of transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Medical-Specific Stopwords: A curated set of stopwords (MEDICAL_STOPWORDS) is defined. These are terms that, while common in English, might not add significant value in the context of specific medical inquiries (e.g., 'patient', 'doctor').\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boilerplate and Special Character Removal: Regular expressions are used to eliminate common boilerplate phrases (like \"Key Points:*-\"), standardize newline characters and multiple spaces, and remove any remaining HTML tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Case Normalization and Hyphen Preservation: All text is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity. Importantly, hyphens within medical terms (e.g., \"T-cell\") are preserved to maintain the integrity and meaning of these specialized phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or subword units (tokens) using word_tokenize.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filtering and Medical Plural Handling:Tokens shorter than two characters are generally removed, with exceptions for medical stopwords that might be short but relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A specialized rule is applied to standardize common medical plural forms (e.g., 'therapies' to 'therapy', 'diseases' to 'disease') to ensure consistency before lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lemmatization: The WordNetLemmatizer reduces words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., 'running' becomes 'run'), further standardizing the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-stage cleaning approach ensures that the dataset's textual content is refined, removing noise while retaining critical medical context, which is vital for the accuracy of our retrieval system."

      "                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.   A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:          -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.    -  Granulocytes (white blood cells) that fight infection and disease.         A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):         -  B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.    -  T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.    -  Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.         In ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called leukemia cells. These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The cancer can also spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).     This summary is about adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia:          -  Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment.    -  Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment.    -  Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment.    -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment.    -  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment.    -  Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment.\n"

Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The following are risk factors for lung cancer:\\n                    Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking      Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women.    Studies have shown that smoking low tar or low nicotine cigarettes does not lower the risk of lung cancer.     Studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. People who smoke have about 20 times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke.       Secondhand smoke    Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is also a risk factor for lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product, or that is exhaled by smokers. People who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to the same cancer -causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts. Inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking.       Family history    Having a family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer. People with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as people who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer. Because cigarette smoking tends to run in families and family members are exposed to secondhand smoke, it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.       HIV infection    Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer. People infected with HIV may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected. Since smoking rates are higher in those infected with HIV than in those not infected, it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from HIV infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.        Environmental risk factors            -   Radiation exposure: Being exposed to radiation is a risk factor for lung cancer. Atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon are sources of radiation exposure:                   - Atomic bomb radiation: Being exposed to radiation after an atomic bomb explosion increases the risk of lung cancer.       - Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy to the chest may be used to treat certain cancers, including breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Radiation therapy uses x-rays, gamma rays, or other types of radiation that may increase the risk of lung cancer. The higher the dose of radiation received, the higher the risk. The risk of lung cancer following radiation therapy is higher in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers.       - Imaging tests: Imaging tests, such as CT scans, expose patients to radiation. Low-dose spiral CT scans expose patients to less radiation than higher dose CT scans. In lung cancer screening, the use of low-dose spiral CT scans can lessen the harmful effects of radiation.       - Radon: Radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil. It seeps up through the ground, and leaks into the air or water supply. Radon can enter homes through cracks in floors, walls, or the foundation, and levels of radon can build up over time.             Studies show that high levels of radon gas inside the home or workplace increase the number of new cases of lung cancer and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers who are exposed to it. In people who have never smoked, about 30% of deaths caused by lung cancer have been linked to being exposed to radon.     -  Workplace exposure: Studies show that being exposed to the following substances increases the risk of lung cancer:                  -  Asbestos.       -  Arsenic.       - Chromium.       - Nickel.       - Beryllium.       -  Cadmium.       - Tar and soot.            These substances can cause lung cancer in people who are exposed to them in the workplace and have never smoked. As the level of exposure to these substances increases, the risk of lung cancer also increases. The risk of lung cancer is even higher in people who are exposed and also smoke.      -  Air pollution: Studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer.              Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers    Taking beta carotene supplements (pills) increases the risk of lung cancer, especially in smokers who smoke one or more packs a day. The risk is higher in smokers who have at least one alcoholic drink every day.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The following are protective factors for lung cancer:\\n                    Not smoking    The best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke.       Quitting smoking    Smokers can decrease their risk of lung cancer by quitting. In smokers who have been treated for lung cancer, quitting smoking lowers the risk of new lung cancers. Counseling, the use of nicotine replacement products, and antidepressant therapy have helped smokers quit for good.    In a person who has quit smoking, the chance of preventing lung cancer depends on how many years and how much the person smoked and the length of time since quitting. After a person has quit smoking for 10 years, the risk of lung cancer decreases 30% to 50%.    See the following for more information on quitting smoking:            -  Tobacco (includes help with quitting)     -  Cigarette Smoking: Health Risks and How to Quit               Lower exposure to workplace risk factors     Laws that protect workers from being exposed to cancer-causing substances, such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, may help lower their risk of developing lung cancer. Laws that prevent smoking in the workplace help lower the risk of lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.       Lower exposure to radon     Lowering radon levels may lower the risk of lung cancer, especially among cigarette smokers. High levels of radon in homes may be reduced by taking steps to prevent radon leakage, such as sealing basements.\\n                \\n                \\n                    It is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer:\\n                    Diet     Some studies show that people who eat high amounts of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those who eat low amounts. However, since smokers tend to have less healthy diets than nonsmokers, it is hard to know whether the decreased risk is from having a healthy diet or from not smoking.       Physical activity    Some studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of lung cancer than people who are not. However, since smokers tend to have different levels of physical activity than nonsmokers, it is hard to know if physical activity affects the risk of lung cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    The following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer:\\n                    Beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers    Studies of nonsmokers show that taking beta carotene supplements does not lower their risk of lung cancer.       Vitamin E supplements      Studies show that taking vitamin E supplements does not affect the risk of lung cancer.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.\\n                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.\\n                \\n                \\n                    New ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\\n                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website. Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials for prevention trials for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer that are now accepting patients. These include trials for quitting smoking.     2\n",

      "New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Radiosensitizers     Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

      "Key Points\\n                    - Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).    - Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.    - Previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL.    - Signs and symptoms of adult ALL include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.     - Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult ALL.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).\\n                    Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; also called acute lymphocytic leukemia) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.\\n                \\n                \\n                    Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\\n                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.   A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:          -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.    -  Granulocytes (white blood cells) that fight infection and disease.         A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):         -  B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.    -  T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.    -  Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.         In ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called leukemia cells. These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The cancer can also spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).     This summary is about adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

    "## 7. Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the hybrid search system, a dedicated evaluation framework is implemented. This framework uses a `validation_set` containing predefined queries, expected keywords, and specific testing parameters like `disease` filters and `min_similarity` thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `evaluate_model` function systematically runs each test case from the `validation_set` through the `hybrid_search` function. It then analyzes the retrieved answers to determine if any of the `expected` keywords are present. This provides an indication of whether the system successfully retrieves relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation process includes:\n",
    "* **Structured Test Cases**: A `validation_data` list defines specific queries with associated `expected` keywords that should appear in a relevant answer, an optional `disease` filter, and a `min_similarity` threshold for that query.\n",
    "* **Hybrid Search Execution**: Each query is passed to the `hybrid_search` function, utilizing the `disease` filter and `min_similarity` for the test.\n",
    "* **Keyword Presence Check**: The function checks if any of the `expected` keywords are present in the `answer` of the top retrieved results.\n",
    "* **Pass/Fail Determination**: A test case is marked as \"PASS\" if at least one expected keyword is found in any of the retrieved answers, indicating a relevant match.\n",
    "* **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive print statements provide immediate feedback on each test case, including found keywords, best match details, and the overall result (PASS/FAIL).\n",
    "* **Summary Statistics**: A final report provides the total number of tests, passed tests, failed tests, and an overall accuracy score.\n",
    "* **Failed Case Details**: An optional section displays more detailed information for any test cases that failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation approach allows for targeted assessment of the model's ability to retrieve information for specific types of cancer-related queries and helps in identifying areas for improvement."

This threshold determines the minimum combined similarity score a match must achieve to be returned by `hybrid_search`.

      "                    Squamous cells are thin, flat cells found in tissues that form the surface of the skin and the lining of body cavities such as the mouth, hollow organs such as the uterus and blood vessels, and the lining of the respiratory (breathing) and digestive tracts. Some organs with squamous cells are the esophagus, lungs, kidneys, and uterus. Cancer can begin in squamous cells anywhere in the body and metastasize (spread) through the blood or lymph system to other parts of the body.    When squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck or around the collarbone, it is called metastatic squamous neck cancer. The doctor will try to find the primary tumor (the cancer that first formed in the body), because treatment for metastatic cancer is the same as treatment for the primary tumor. For example, when lung cancer spreads to the neck, the cancer cells in the neck are lung cancer cells and they are treated the same as the cancer in the lung. Sometimes doctors cannot find where in the body the cancer first began to grow. When tests cannot find a primary tumor, it is called an occult (hidden) primary tumor. In many cases, the primary tumor is never found.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through dedicated effort and a systematic approach, we have successfully developed and optimized a robust medical chatbot designed for cancer information retrieval. Our system stands on a hybrid search methodology, intelligently combining the strengths of traditional TF-IDF with the advanced semantic understanding of BioBERT embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the development of our medical chatbot for cancer information retrieval, we encountered several key challenges. Overcoming these obstacles was crucial for the successful completion and optimization of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Quality and Preprocessing:**\n",
    "    * **Heterogeneous Data Formats:** The initial MedQuAD dataset, while rich in content, presented in XML format required careful parsing to extract the relevant question-answer pairs and associated metadata. Ensuring consistent extraction across diverse XML structures was an initial hurdle.\n",
    "    * **Text Cleaning Complexity:** Medical text often contains specific terminology, abbreviations, and formatting that required tailored preprocessing. Striking the right balance with our `clean_text` function was challenging; aggressive cleaning for search (e.g., extensive lemmatization, stopword removal) could lead to unreadable output for display, while insufficient cleaning hindered retrieval accuracy. This was evident when our initial Gradio output was \"jibberish,\" prompting us to implement a dual-cleaning strategy (one for search, one for display). \n",
    "    * **Duplicate and Near-Duplicate Entries:** Identifying and handling duplicate or near-duplicate question-answer pairs was essential to prevent bias in our index and ensure unique, meaningful responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Model Selection and Integration:**\n",
    "    * **Hybrid Search Complexity:** Combining two distinct retrieval methodologies—TF-IDF for lexical matching and BioBERT for semantic understanding—required careful design. Determining how to effectively blend their scores to leverage the strengths of both was a core challenge.\n",
    "    * **Computational Resources for Embeddings:** Encoding the entire dataset's questions into BioBERT embeddings was a computationally intensive task, especially in environments with limited GPU access. This necessitated efficient batch processing and careful memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Performance Tuning and Evaluation:**\n",
    "    * **Defining \"Success\":** Establishing clear and measurable criteria for what constitutes a \"successful\" retrieval was more complex than a simple exact match. Our `evaluate_model` function needed to account for similarity thresholds *and* the presence of expected keywords, particularly for distinguishing relevant from irrelevant answers in negative test cases.\n",
    "    * **Parameter Optimization:** Systematically tuning the `tfidf_weight`, `semantic_weight`, and the internal `threshold` of the `hybrid_search` function was an iterative process. Finding the optimal combination that maximized accuracy across diverse test cases (including negative ones) required careful experimentation and analysis of the evaluation results.\n",
    "    * **Handling Edge Cases/Negative Tests:** The \"What is the best way to cook pasta?\" query highlighted a specific challenge: ensuring genuinely irrelevant queries resulted in either no match or a similarity score below the acceptable threshold. Our initial setup struggled with this, as even semantically unrelated texts could show minor (but still problematic) similarity, leading to \"Unexpected high similarity for negative test\" failures.\n",
    "4.  **User Interface Development:**\n",
    "    * **Seamless Integration:** Connecting the backend `hybrid_search` logic to a frontend interface (Gradio) required careful attention to function signatures and data flow. Ensuring that the output from the retrieval system was correctly formatted and displayed in a user-friendly manner was essential for a good user experience.\n",
    "    * **Displaying Clean vs. Raw Text:** The conflict between text optimized for retrieval (heavily cleaned) and text suitable for human readability (lighter cleaning) for display purposes was a practical challenge that we addressed by maintaining separate `question_cleaned_for_search` and `answer_display` columns. \n",
    "    \n",
    "By systematically addressing these challenges, we were able to refine our approach, improve our code, and ultimately deliver a robust and effective medical chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "While our current model performs exceptionally well on the validation set, we have identified several areas for future improvements to further enhance its capabilities and prepare it for real-world deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Expand and Diversify Training Data:**\n",
    "    * **Larger Dataset:** We recommend incorporating a larger and more diverse dataset. This would cover a broader range of cancer types, related questions, and comprehensive answers, which would significantly improve the model's generalization.\n",
    "    * **Data Annotation:** We believe that manually annotating more data with specific entities (e.g., drug names, symptoms) or intent types would enable us to explore more advanced NLP techniques.\n",
    "    * **Negative Sampling:** Actively curating more diverse negative examples, beyond simple irrelevant queries (like \"cook pasta\"), to include questions somewhat related to the medical domain but not specific to cancer, would greatly improve the model's robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Explore Advanced NLP Models:**\n",
    "    * **Fine-tuning BioBERT/other LLMs:** Instead of solely relying on pre-trained embeddings, fine-tuning BioBERT or other domain-specific Language Models (LLMs) directly on our specific Q&A dataset could further boost performance and understanding of nuances in cancer questions.\n",
    "    * **Generative AI Integration:** For queries where a direct answer isn't immediately found, we could integrate a generative AI model (e.g., a fine-tuned LLM) capable of synthesizing information from retrieved passages to create more conversational and complete answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Refine Answer Extraction and Summarization:**\n",
    "    * **Passage Re-ranking:** For the top `n` results retrieved by `hybrid_search`, we could apply a more sophisticated re-ranking model (e.g., a cross-encoder model) to identify the absolute best match, especially when `n` is greater than 1.\n",
    "    * **Answer Span Extraction:** Instead of returning entire answer documents, we aim to implement techniques to extract only the most relevant sentence or paragraph that directly answers the user's query, providing more concise responses.\n",
    "    * **Summarization:** For very long answers, we recommend exploring abstractive or extractive summarization techniques to provide users with a brief, digestible overview."
